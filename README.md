# ENGR_445_StepCount
Step Counting Algorithm developed in Embedded System Design, ENGR445

StepCount_SetData_app: Translated pipeline into code by creating an algorithm that would detect peaks of accelerometer that I collected knowing the number of total steps walked.

SPI_Loopback: Learning how to configure the SPI interface by sending and receiving the same random 8-bit value.

SPI_Read&Write_app: Learning how to read and write between the accelerometer by writing to a register within the accelerometer with a knwon value to test understanding before transfering data.

SPI_Interface_ADXL_app: Read and write to the accelerometer registers in order to acquire X, Y, and Z acceleration data.

Step_Counting_app: Immlement the C++ code with the finite state machine to filter the data and detect peaks from the acceleromter in live time.
