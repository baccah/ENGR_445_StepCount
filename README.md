# ENGR_445_StepCount
Step Counting Algorithm developed in Embedded System Design, ENGR445

Walk Detection and Step Counting: Started the project with the excel file used to test the pipeline for filtering and detecting peaks of set data.

C++ for set data: Translated pipeline into code by creating an algorithm that would detect peaks of accelerometer that I collected knowing the number of total steps walked.

SPI Loopback: Learning how to configure the SPI interface by sending and receiving the same random 8-bit value.

SPI Read&Write: Learning how to read and write between the accelerometer by writing to a register within the accelerometer with a knwon value to test understanding before transfering data.

SPI Interface ADXL: Read and write to the accelerometer registers in order to acquire X, Y, and Z acceleration data.

Step Counting: Immlement the C++ code with the finite state machine to filter the data and detect peaks from the acceleromter in live time.
